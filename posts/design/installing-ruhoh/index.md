[Ruhoh](http://www.ruhoh.com) is an excellent blogging package by Jade Dominguez. I evaluated Jekyll, Hyde, Octopress, Blogger, Tumblr, Posterous and several others but was unsatisfied with various facets of each package. Ruhoh combines Twitter Bootstrap, Markdown and a convenient command-line API into a coherent package that stays out of your way.

## Installation

    $ sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.3
    $ sudo gem install ruhoh

Ruhoh is ready. Follow the [documentation to create a blog](http://ruhoh.com/usage/).
