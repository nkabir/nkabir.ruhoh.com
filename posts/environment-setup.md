## Setting Up Your Environment

#### Install VirtualBox

Download the latest VirtualBox package for [your host system](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). Run the installer.

Download the 64bit Desktop version of Xubuntu from [http://xubuntu.org/getxubuntu/](http://xubuntu.org/getxubuntu/)

Open VirtualBox, and click the "New" button in the upper left hand corner.
Use the following settings:

* **Name**: *stemcell*
* **Operating System**: *Linux*
* **Version**: *Ubuntu (64 bit)*
* **Memory**: *2048 MB*
* **Hard disk**: *VDI, Dynamically allocated, 500 GB*

In **Settings -> Storage**, click *Add CD/DVD device*, Choose the hard disk and locate the Xubuntu ISO in the Downloads folder.

In **Settings -> Network**, choose *Attached to: Bridged Adapter*.

Now *Start* your virtual machine and configure Xubuntu.

#### Install Xubuntu Desktop 12.04

You will first need to install Xubuntu on your empty virtual machine. This is done through a series of graphical menus:

* **Welcome** - The default language is *English*. Select *Install Xubuntu*.

* **Preparing to install Xubuntu** - Check *Download updates while installing* and *Install this third-party software*. Select *Continue*.

* **Installation type** - Check *Erase disk and install Xubuntu*. Select *Continue*.

* **Erase disk and install Xubuntu** - Use the default for *Select drive*. Select *Install now*.

* **Where are you?** - Use *New York*. Select *Continue*.

* **Keyboard layout** - For keyboard layout, choose *English (US)*. Select *Continue*.

* **Who are you?** - Create a guest account. We will create your actual user a little later
  * Your name: *Ubtunu*
  * Your computer's name: *stemcell*
  * Pick a username: *ubuntu*
  * Choose a password: *secret*
  * Confirm your password: *secret*
  * Choose whether you would like to log in automatically or always be prompted for your password. The system will begin installing.

* **Installation Complete** - Select *Restart Now*.

The .iso will be ejected automatically. Press ENTER and the system will reboot. 

#### Create a User

Let us pretend that your user's name is Alice Smith. To add Alice as a user, type the following
    
    $ sudo adduser asmith
    $ sudo usermod -a -G sudo asmith
    
The second line gives *asmith* "sudo" powers. Give *asmith* a private password. Log out and log in as *asmith*.

#### Install Guest Additions

Go to the *Devices* tab in the VirtualBox Manager and select *Install Guest Additions*. Inside your virtual machine a CD will appear on the desktop. Execute the following

    $ sudo apt-get install dkms
    $ cd /media/VBOXADDITIONS
    $ sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
    
At this stage, you should take a snapshot.

#### Take a Snapshot

A good practice is to take a snapshot of your virtual machine every time you make a significant change. This will ensure that you have a clean system to go back to in case you accidentally corrupt your environment. A clean system is essential when developing software that other people are going to use.

After the system has rebooted, *Shut Down* your machine (in the upper right hand menu). It is good to take a snapshot while your machine is off. In the Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager window, click on the Snapshots tab, and click the camera icon to make a snapshot of the fresh install. Call it "fresh-install".

#### Install Updates

Open *Accessories > Terminal Emulator*. Execute the following commands:

    $ wget https://raw.github.com/gist/2703110/25dd6b7be4752b2d3c5932ac1f9e30f38b401139/sources.list
    $ sudo cp sources.list /etc/apt/
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get upgrade

You will need to reboot.

#### Install Dropbox

Execute

    $ sudo apt-get install nautilus-dropbox
    $ dropbox start -i

Then enter your login and password information. You will be prompted to install the latest version. Do not select this. Select "Don't Ask Again". Choose the "Typical" installation.
