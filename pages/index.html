        Our aim to to provide a suite of services that give students exposure to real-world software engineering practices using free, open source tools. By using free and open source tools, we achieve two important goals for the students: we prepare them with tools they can keep after they complete the program and we encourage them to tinker to better understand their workflow. <a href="#">Get started...</a>

            <div class="blurb">
            <p>We use Mercurial, a free, distributed source control system written in Python and C. Mercurial is quick, scalable and easy to learn. Mercurial uses an HTTP-based protocol by default.</p>

            <h2>Code Review</h2>            
            <p>Code review is considered complimentary to testing and has been shown to be effective at improving software quality. We use the excellent ReviewBoard code review application.</p>

            <h2>Continuous Build</h2>
            <p>In software engineering, continuous integration (CI) implements continuous processes of applying quality control â€” small pieces of effort, applied frequently.</p>

            <h2>Metrics</h2>
            <p>Sonar is a web-based software metrics application. Rules, alerts, thresholds, exclusions, and settings can be configured online. Sonar keeps historical measures of development progress.</p>

            <h2>Code Search</h2>
            <p>OpenGrok is a fast and usable source code search and cross reference engine. It helps you search, cross-reference and navigate your source tree. It can understand various program file formats and version control histories.</p>

            <h2>Build Artifacts</h2>
            <p>When code has been reviewed, tested and measured, it's ready for deployment. A central artifact repository ensures that all downstream processes use the right artifacts in their deployments.</p>
