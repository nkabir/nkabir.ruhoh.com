  <h3>About transitions</h3>
  <p>For simple transition effects, include bootstrap-transition.js once alongside the other JS files. If you're using the compiled (or minified) bootstrap.js, there is no need to include this&mdash;it's already there.</p>
  <h3>Use cases</h3>
  <p>A few examples of the transition plugin:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sliding or fading in modals</li>
    <li>Fading out tabs</li>
    <li>Fading out alerts</li>
    <li>Sliding carousel panes</li>
  </ul>
